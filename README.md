Intersection Strategies

Practical industry intelligence and operational systems for small business owners.

This repository hosts two versions of a one-page overview:
- A web version for quick sharing
- A print-ready PDF version that fits on a single Letter page

Both are intentionally simple, fast, and readable by non-technical audiences.

## Who This Is For

This is for owners and operators who:
- Are dealing with industry change (pricing pressure, consolidation, staffing, new tech)
- Want clarity and direction — not software pitches or generic consulting decks
- Prefer practical systems that reduce chaos and compound over time

If you run a small or midsize business and need to make better decisions under uncertainty, this is for you.
