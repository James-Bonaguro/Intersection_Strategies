\mysection{About Me}

I grew up in Orland Park where my family owned Mercedes-Benz of Orland Park. I worked there through high school and college, covering the sales floor, finance office, and service department. That is where I learned how a business actually runs, not just from a textbook.

After earning a finance degree from Miami University and spending a few years in healthcare consulting, I returned to help run the family business. I focused on modernizing our operations, implementing new finance and technology platforms, and building systems that made people's jobs easier instead of harder.

Eventually, I entered the public enterprise technology space, building internal tools and workflow systems for over 150 people across multiple teams. I saw what works at scale.

Now, I run Intersection Strategies to help a wide variety of businesses make sense of what's changing in their industry and figure out what to do about it.
