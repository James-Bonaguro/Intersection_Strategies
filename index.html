      <h2 class="section-title">What I Do</h2>
      <p class="big">
        I help owners make clear decisions when the ground is shifting: pricing pressure, staffing, consolidation, competitor moves, and new tech that is hard to evaluate quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        My edge is that I have lived in both worlds: the day to day reality of a family business and the systems thinking of enterprise tech.
        I do not hand you a strategy deck. I help you see what is coming, pick a direction, and build a simple operating system that holds up.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Background</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in Orland Park where my family owned <strong>Mercedes-Benz of Orland Park</strong>. I worked the sales floor, the finance office,
        and the service department. That is where you learn the real constraints: people, process, timing, and cashflow.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a finance degree from <strong>Miami University</strong> and a stint in healthcare consulting, I came back to help run the family business.
        I focused on modernization: tightening operations, implementing finance and technology platforms, and building workflows that made work easier instead of harder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later I moved into enterprise technology, building internal tools and workflow systems used by <strong>150+ people</strong> across multiple teams.
        That is where you learn what scales, what breaks, and how to build systems that survive growth.
      </p>
