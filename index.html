        <p>
          Competitor moves, market shifts, and the “what’s actually changing” signal—so you can decide before it’s obvious.

        <h3>Operations &amp; Tools</h3>
        <p>

      <div class="block">
        <h3>Research &amp; Training</h3>

        If you’re a small business owner, you don’t need another “consultant.” You need someone who gets how work really flows—and
        can translate change into decisions.

      <h2 class="section-title">What I Do (In Plain English)</h2>
      <p class="big">
        I help owners make better decisions when the ground is shifting—pricing pressure, new tech, competitor moves, staffing,
        consolidation, and changing customer expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        My edge is that I’ve lived in both worlds: the day-to-day reality of a family business and the systems thinking of enterprise tech.
        I don’t hand you a “strategy deck.” I help you see what’s coming, pick a direction, and build a simple operating system that holds up.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Why You Can Trust I’ll Get It</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in Orland Park where my family owned <strong>Mercedes-Benz of Orland Park</strong>. I worked the sales floor, the finance office,
        and the service department. That’s where you learn the truth: a business doesn’t run on ideas—it runs on people, process, timing,
        and cashflow.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a finance degree from <strong>Miami University</strong> and a stint in healthcare consulting, I came back to help run the family business.
        I focused on modernization: tightening operations, implementing finance/technology platforms, and building workflows that made work easier
        instead of harder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later I moved into enterprise technology—building internal tools and workflow systems used by <strong>150+ people</strong> across multiple teams.
        That’s where you learn what scales, what breaks, and how to design systems that survive growth.
      </p>
      <p class="callout">
        Today, Intersection Strategies is where those worlds meet: practical “owner brain” + enterprise-grade execution.

      <ol class="steps">
        <li><strong>30 minutes:</strong> you tell me what’s stressful, what’s unclear, and what you’re trying to decide.</li>
        <li><strong>I map the situation:</strong> where the industry is moving, what competitors are doing, what actually matters for ROI.</li>
        <li><strong>We pick 1–2 moves:</strong> small changes that reduce chaos now and compound over time.</li>
